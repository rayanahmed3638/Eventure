Eventure
Eventure is a smart event recommendation platform that helps you decide whether a networking event is worth attending.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Too often, people attend networking events only to find they have little in common with the attendees. Eventure solves this by analyzing attendee data and recommending events that align with your interests.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Aggregates local networking events in your area

Checks whoâ€™s attending each event

Scrapes public information about attendees (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

Identifies their fields of interest and professional background

Uses this data to rate the event based on compatibility with your profile

âœ… Outcome
Youâ€™ll get a personalized score for each event, helping you make informed decisions about which ones are truly worth your time.
